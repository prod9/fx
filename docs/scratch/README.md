# Scratch

**Unsettled exploration** — research dumps, surveys, investigations, drafts, transcripts:
thinking-in-progress whose claims are not expected to stay current. This is the residual
home. Material lands here only when it fits nothing above it in the routing gate — never as
a default.

Belongs here *only* if it is genuinely exploratory. A ruling is `../decisions/`; current or
intended design (including our own exact surface) is `../spec/`; third-party lookup is
`../vendor/`; a task walkthrough is `../guides/`.

**Toll.** Open every scratch file with one line naming why it is not spec or a decision:

```
<!-- not spec/decision because: still exploring; no ruling made yet -->
```

If you cannot write that line honestly, the artifact belongs in one of those folders — put
it there instead.

## Format

One file per artifact: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` (the date matters — scratch is about the moment
it was written). No template; write whatever shape fits.

## Lifecycle

Disposable. Edit, rewrite, or delete freely. When exploration settles into a ruling or a
design, promote the durable claim up to `../decisions/` or `../spec/`; what remains here is
the raw working material.

Two carve-outs on deletion:

- **Cited provenance is retained.** A note a frozen `../decisions/` ruling cites as its
  provenance stays, even though scratch is disposable — disposability governs new filing,
  not deletion of already-cited material. Never orphan a decision's citation.
- **Collapse instead of scatter.** When design notes pile up on one theme, consolidate them
  into a single `prior-art.md` digest — one section per source, each cross-linked to the
  live `../spec/` or `../decisions/` doc it fed — then repoint citations and drop the
  absorbed notes. `prior-art.md` is the one undated file here.
